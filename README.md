# Trust and Safety

The entire code for this and more is open-source because I don't want to spend hours encoding stuff and so people can see the code to proove themselfs it's safe.
I don't use risky software but if you do find any malware in RoTilities please open it in Issues and I'll update it.

# License

You can use this software and the code freely, exception if you're taking the entire code from me and putting it into you're repo, I don't really care if you use pieces of code nor bits but grabbing the entire software and putting it elsewhere is not nice and immoral. And monetizing off of this is ripping people off.

Read the License file to learn more.
